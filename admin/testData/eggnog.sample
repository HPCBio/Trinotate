As ProRS can inadvertently accommodate and process non-cognate amino acids such as alanine and cysteine, to avoid such errors it has two additional distinct editing activities against alanine. One activity is designated as 'pretransfer' editing and involves the tRNA-independent hydrolysis of activated Ala-AMP. The other activity is designated 'posttransfer' editing and involves deacylation of mischarged Ala-tRNA. The misacylated Cys- tRNA is not edited by ProRS protein

GrpE releases ADP from dnaK; ATP binding to dnaK triggers the release of the substrate protein, thus completing the reaction cycle. Several rounds of ATP-dependent interactions between dnaJ, dnaK and grpE are required for fully efficient folding (By similarity)
